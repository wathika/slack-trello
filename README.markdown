== README

The slack-responder app responds to Trello POST requests and creates Trello cards.  Our [Slack Command blog post](http://www.medivo.com/blog/slack-slash-command-to-trello/) provides a detailed walkthrough to get this app up-and-running to create cards on Trello backlog boards that correspond with Slack channels.  Here's a high-level summary of the setup steps:

1. Create a .env file and set the required environment variables

2. Deploy the app somewhere

3. Create a Slack command that sends POST requests to your_app_url/slack/work

Additional features will be added soon!

Feel free to submit a pull request if you have any improvements.
